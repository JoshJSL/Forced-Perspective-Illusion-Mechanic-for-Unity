# Forced-Perspective-Illusion-Mechanic-for-Unity
Forced Perspective Illusion scenes on Unity 3D, similar to Pillow Castle's puzzle

# Explanation
This is a single script project that simulates forced perspective illusion, like Pillow Castle's puzzle game.
In forced perspective optical illusions objects that are farther away appear smaller than it actually is. In this puzzle scene, once the object that is ayaw from the player is "taken", the visual scale is forced on the object to make it appear to be the same size, once the object is dropped, it is possible to notice that the object was scaled in relation to the farther background.
This project was made to test the possibility to create such illusion on Unity.
